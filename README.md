The primary idea of this project to build a software that have various language common sentences at a single place so that by using these basic sentences  one can easily get mingle with new place and communicate with peoples. The mother language used as english. As we all know google is very powerful search engine but when we search for these type of  quary than it take much time to execute and we have to go through lot of links to get our result. So Lingvito have much more power to compete with todays search engine in these types of serach. Lingvito is implemented in python using json, Elastic search as database  & HTML and CSS to build UI. Searching of query can be excecuted on both console and web based search. Query is  searched in using kibana using google js database to reduce execution time.
Future we want to add this application to implement to find syntex of various programming language so that it will be very useful to get hands on new programming language.
